                <hr>
                <p>The Model G20 Summer Program program is intended as an additional learning opportunity for alumni of the 2017 MG20 Youth Leadership Summit held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The MG20 was organized to support high schools learn about international relations, politics and open their considerations to future academic and professional pathways. While the MG20 focused on macro-topics and themes of global relations, the Crossroads program invites students to consider the factors that shape global politics on a local level. Qingdao will be the case-study, and the intersections of east and west will the focus.<br><br>

                    During the MG20, students learned about some of the most pressing realities facing the world today: global sustainability, economic development, and security. In CrossRoads, students will explore these same themes, on a local level and in an international context. By understanding the social, economic and environmental realities in the city of Qingdao, students will walk away with parallel knowledge in their own home cities and its implications for the development of future global relationships.

            <h3>About Qingdao</h3>
            <p>Qingdao (also spelled Tsingtao) is a city in eastern Shandong Province on the east coast of China. Qīng (青) in Chinese means "cyan" or "greenish-blue", while dǎo (岛) means "island". Qingdao is a unique city; its uniqueness lies in its cultural significance, colonial history, and strategic importance in Modern China. Mount Lao, northeastern to Downtown Qingdao, is regarded as the cradle of Taosim; Qufu City, eastern to Qingdao, is the hometown of Confucius. At the end of the 19th century, Qingdao became a colony of Germany and the continuing occupation by Japan after 1914 stimulated one of the most significant youth movements the May Fourth Movement in 1919. Current Qingdao is a major seaport, naval base, and industrial center. It is one of the easter hubs for President Xi’s One Road One Belt Strategy.
